 * Description:  This file contains a unit test for the endTurn() function in
 *               dominion.c
 * Business Requirements for endTurn():
 * 1. endTurn() should execute the final cleanup phase of the current player's 
 *    turn. In the cleanup phase, the player must discard all unplayed cards 
 *    and played cards back to the discard pile and draw again 5 new cards.
 * 2. endTurn() should change the gameState from the current player's turn to
 *    the beginning of the next player's turn.
 * 3. endTurn() should not change any other gameState variables except those
 *    required to execute 1 and 2 above.
