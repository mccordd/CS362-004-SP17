 * Description:  This file contains a unit test for the Feast card in  
 *               dominion.c
 * Business Requirements for Feast:
 * 1. Feast card is trashed, and a card costing up to 5 is gained from the 
 *    supply, using up an Action.
 * 2. No other change to the gameState is made except that required to 
 *    accomplish the above action.
 * 3. A player is not permitted to use a Feast card to gain a card from the
 *    supply costing more than 5.
 * 4. A player is not permitted to use a Feast card to gain a card that is
 *    not in the supply.
