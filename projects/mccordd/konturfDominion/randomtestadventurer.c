 * Description:  This file contains a random test generator for the Adventurer 
 *               card in dominion.c
 * Business Requirements for Adventurer:
 * 1. The player uses an action to draw cards from the deck until 2 Treasure 
 *    cards are found. The following caveats apply -
 *    a) The Treasure cards are placed in the player's hand while all 
 *       non-Treasure cards that are found are discarded.
 *    b) If it is necessary to shuffle in the middle, then the player should
 *       do so.
 *    c) If the player runs out of cards and still only has one treasure, then
 *       the player only gets one treasure.
 * 2. Nothing else changes in the game state except what is required to 
 *    accomplish the above actions. 
 * 3. If the player does not have actions available, then he/she cannot use
 *    the card.
