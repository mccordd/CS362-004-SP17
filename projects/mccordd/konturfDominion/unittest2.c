 * Description:  This file contains a unit test for the initializeGame() 
 *               function in dominion.c
 * Business Requirements for initializeGame():
 * 1. initializeGame() should set up a game state for the start of the game
 *    according to the standard Dominion rules. This includes
 *    a) Supply with the proper number of Treasure, Victory, Curse, and Kingdom
 *       cards based on the number of players in the game.
 *    b) Each player has 10 cards - 7 coppers and 3 estates. 5 of the cards
 *       are in each of the players' hands and 5 are in each of the players'
 *       decks.
 * 2. initializeGame() should check that valid game variables have been passed
 *    to it, including a valid number of players and a valid set of kingdom
 *    cards.
