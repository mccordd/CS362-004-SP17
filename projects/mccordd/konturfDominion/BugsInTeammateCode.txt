Title:  Dominion Refactored Bug Report for Frederick Kontur

Title: fullDeckCount() is the wrong function for its use
Date:	5/25/17         
Reported By: Doug McCord   
Email: mccordd@oregonstate.edu


Product: Dominion Code          Version: KonturFDominion from 362 Assignment-4
Tester: unittest1.c             Version: mccordd's test from 362 Assignment-3, refactored     

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
Function AS USED appears designed to return a total count of a player's draw, hand and 
discard pile for use of the Gardens card. But the function AS WRITTEN takes a card as an
argument and counts the occurrences of this card. This is being used in the scoreFor function
with the Gardens card to gather a total, but passes card number 0 (this enum is the Curse card, so it counts occurrences of Curse). 

Steps to Produce/Reproduce with Expected and Actual Results:
--------------------------
Run fullDeckCount with a card value passed to it. It will never return the total count of all
cards! Beyond unit testing, run the scoreFor with a Gardens card in hand and it will never be
counted properly. 

Estimated Severity
--------------
5/10 – game cannot score Gardens cards properly as implemented. But the game can easily
be played without Garden card.  

Estimated Priority
--------------
Of these bugs, #2. Requires gardens card to run afoul, hands can be played without this, 
but playing with Garden card ruins it's use.  

Proposed Fix
--------------
Modify this function to return the total of the passed player's 
state->handCount[player] + state->deckCount[player] + state->discardCount[player],  
which is actually much simpler than what is there.

Title: scoreFor searches by handCount and discardCount twice, instead of drawCount
Date:	5/25/17         
Reported By: Doug McCord   
Email: mccordd@oregonstate.edu


Product: Dominion Code          Version: KonturFDominion from 362 Assignment-4
Tester: unittest2.c             Version: mccordd's test from 362 Assignment-3, refactored     

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
When this function iterates through a player's draw, hand and discard counts to count victory
cards, it currently uses the hand and then discard twice. In cases where there is no
discard, it will not count anything but what's in hand, and the totals will be wrong in most
cases. 

Steps to Produce/Reproduce with Expected and Actual Results:
--------------------------
Initialize a game and run scoreFor. As no one has discards yet, you'll see improper counts 
for victory. 

Estimated Severity
--------------
8/10 – game can't tally an accurate score. You can still the run the game, but scores 
will not be accurate. 

Estimated Priority
--------------
Of these bugs, #1. Game cannot be correctly played in most configurations without this 
fix.  

Proposed Fix
--------------
Change the counters to score hand, discard and deck -- now they score hand, discard and
discard. This could be a very simple fix -- it requires changing the loop condition count, 
and then the source for the lines of card evaluation within the loop.

Title: Smithy card is never discarded when played
Date:	5/26/17         
Reported By: Doug McCord   
Email: mccordd@oregonstate.edu


Product: Dominion Code          Version: KonturFDominion from 362 Assignment-4
Tester: cardtest1.c             Version: mccordd's test from 362 Assignment-3, refactored     

Is it reproducible: Yes

Description
===========
The Smithy card correctly adds three cards to the player's hand from the top of the
player's deck, but it never discards itself. 

Steps to Produce/Reproduce with Expected and Actual Results:
--------------------------
Run the refactored smithy function – smithyEffect(). It will draw 3 cards from the player's
 deck into the player's hand correctly, but end with one extra card (the source Smithy 
 Card). 

Estimated Severity
--------------
3/10 –  game can be played without this kingdom card, but this card remains in the hand, 
so if a player had extra actions they could theoretically continue to play it.  

Estimated Priority
--------------
Of these bugs, #3 or lowest priority. This card works, the game can be played – it's just 
too beneficial. It's not even the most broken of the cards, and you can play without it, 
as it's a kingdom card. 

Proposed Fix
--------------
Add the standard discard line the calls the dominion discard function at the hand
position of the Smithy Card.
